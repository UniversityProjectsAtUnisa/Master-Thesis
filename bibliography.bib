	abstract = {Objective: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder arising from anomalies of the electrical activity in the brain, affecting {\textasciitilde}65 million individuals worldwide. Prediction methods, typically based on machine learning methods, require a large amount of data for training, in order to correctly classify seizures with small false alarm rates. Methods: In this work, we present a new database containing EEG scalp signals of 14 epileptic patients acquired at the Unit of Neurology and Neurophysiology of the University of Siena, Italy. Furthermore, a patient-specific seizure prediction method, based on the detection of synchronization patterns in the EEG, is proposed and tested on the data of the database. The use of noninvasive EEG data aims to explore the possibility of developing a noninvasive monitoring/control device for the prediction of seizures. The prediction method employs synchronization measures computed over all channel pairs and a computationally inexpensive threshold-based classification approach. Results and conclusions: The experimental analysis, performed by inspection and by the proposed threshold-based classifier on all the patients of the database, shows that the features extracted by the synchronization measures are able to detect preictal and ictal states and allow the prediction of the seizures few minutes before the seizure onsets.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a paroxysmal condition characterized by repeated transient seizures separated by longer interictal periods. Ictogenesis describes the processes of transition from the interictal state to a seizure. The processes include a preictal state, with specific clinical signs and a distinct electrophysiology which may provide opportunities to anticipate, or even prevent, seizures. Biological mechanisms of ictogenesis remain poorly understood and may vary between conditions/syndromes. We review here ictogenic processes including the involvement of pyramidal cells, interneurons and astrocytes, GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling, and ionic perturbations. Our review suggests that specific excitatory influences at the transition to an ictal event include (1) GABA receptor activation with a neuronal Cl− load and (2) a transient increase in external K+.
While seizure onset patterns have been the subject of many reports, there have been few studies of seizure termination. In this study we report the incidence of synchronous and asynchronous termination patterns of partial seizures recorded with intracranial arrays.
Data were collected from patients with intractable complex partial seizures undergoing presurgical evaluations with intracranial electrodes. Patients with seizures originating from mesial temporal and neocortical regions were grouped into three groups based on patterns of seizure termination: synchronous only (So), asynchronous only (Ao), or mixed (S/A, with both synchronous and asynchronous termination patterns).
88\% of the patients in the MT group had seizures with a synchronous pattern of termination exclusively (38\%) or mixed (50\%). 82\% of the NC group had seizures with synchronous pattern of termination exclusively (52\%) or mixed (30\%). In the NC group, there was a significant difference of the range of seizure durations between So and Ao groups, with Ao exhibiting higher variability. Seizures with synchronous termination had low variability in both groups.
Synchronous seizure termination is a common pattern for complex partials seizures of both mesial temporal or neocortical onset. This may reflect stereotyped network behavior or dynamics at the seizure focus.
C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) is one of the most well characterized chemokine receptors and is a potential target for treating brain pathologies involving inflammatory processes, including epilepsy. However, the role of CXCR2 in epilepsy has not been investigated, and whether CXCR2 modulates seizure activity in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to determine the potential role of CXCR2 in intractable TLE patients and in pilocarpine-induced epileptic mice. Here, through Western blotting and semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry, we detected that CXCR2 protein expression was up-regulated (by nearly 50\%) in the temporal neocortex of TLE patients and in the hippocampus and adjacent temporal cortex of pilocarpine mice model. Double-label immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analysis indicated that CXCR2 was expressed in neurons. To investigate the effect of the CXCR2 selective antagonist SB225002 on seizure activity, SB225002 was i.p. administered during the latency window of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs). This treatment increased (by nearly 40\%) the latency of SRSs and reduced (by nearly 50\%) the frequency of SRSs during the chronic period of epilepsy. This study suggests that CXCR2 plays a critical role in modifying epileptic seizure activity and that CXCR2 blockade could be a potential molecular therapeutic target for epilepsy.
Décrire la population adulte sous polythérapie pour une épilepsie focale, en France, en appliquant la nouvelle définition internationale de la pharmacorésistance (2009).
Étude observationnelle, transversale, menée auprès de neurologues français.
Soixante et onze neurologues investigateurs ont inclus 405 patients épileptiques sous polythérapie, d’âge moyen 42,7 ans, dont l’épilepsie avait débuté en moyenne 25 ans avant l’inclusion : 60 \% des patients étaient pharmacorésistants, 37 \% pharmacosensibles et 3 \% de statut indéfini. Après réévaluation par deux experts, 71 \% des patients étaient pharmacorésistants, 22 \% pharmacosensibles et 7 \% de statut indéfini. En pratique, 76 \% des investigateurs avaient mal classé au moins un de leurs patients selon la nouvelle définition de la pharmacorésistance. En raison de leur épilepsie, 24 \% des patients (âge ≤ 65 ans) étaient inactifs et 42 \% ne pouvaient pas conduire de véhicule à moteur. La moitié des patients avaient une comorbidité. Les patients pharmacorésistants prenaient plus de médicaments et avaient une consommation de soins plus élevée que les autres.
L’étude ESPERA montre que l’application des nouveaux critères de pharmacorésistance n’est pas simple et confirme le handicap socioprofessionnel des adultes sous polythérapie pour une épilepsie focale.
To describe the adult population treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in combination for focal epilepsy according to the definition of AED resistance proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) in 2009 and to evaluate its implementation in current practice.
ESPERA was a multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study with a clinical data collection covering the past 12 months conducted by neurologists. Classifications according to AED responsiveness established by investigators for each enrolled patient were revised by two experts.
Seventy-one neurologists enrolled 405 patients. Their mean age was 42.7 years (sex-ratio M/F 0.98). According to the investigators, 60\% of epilepsies were drug-resistant, 37\% drug-responsive and 3\% had an undefined drug-responsiveness. After revision of experts, 71\% of epilepsies were classified as drug resistant, 22\% as responsive and 7\% as undefined. Among the participating neurologists, 76\% have made at least one error in classifying their patients according to the 2009 ILAE definition of AED resistance. Because of epilepsy, 24\% of patients (age ≤ 65) were inactive and 42\% could not drive (respectively 29 and 49\% of patients with AED resistant epilepsy). Half of patients had at least one other chronic condition. Number of prescribed drugs in combination and health care resource utilisation were significantly higher in patients with drug-resistant epilepsies than in patients with drug responsive epilepsies.
ESPERA study shows that the use of new definition of drug-resistance in everyday practice seems difficult without any additional training and that the social and professional disability is frequent in adults with focal epilepsies treated with polytherapy.
We report a challenging case of an atypical presentation of recrudescent herpes simplex virus infection in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency. Oral infections in immunosuppressed patients may present with unusual clinical features that can mimic non-infectious diseases. This report discusses the diagnostic steps necessary for definitive diagnosis and to guide appropriate and effective management.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) may help control seizures in individuals with medically intractable epilepsy who are not candidates for resective surgery. The current review focuses on some preclinical studies of DBS of the piriform cortex (PC), an area involved in the generation and maintenance of seizures, as a potential therapeutic option for refractory epilepsy. We also present findings suggesting the safety of low frequency stimulation (LFS) of the PC on memory. A variety of LFS parameters have been suggested as an effective treatment strategy for refractory epilepsy. In generalized epilepsy, however, recent studies suggest that LFS may exacerbate seizures and high frequency stimulation (HFS) might be an alternative. Hence, further studies are required to explore the potential therapeutic targets and proper stimulation parameters for the successful translation of DBS of the PC to the clinic.
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy. A proposed risk marker for SUDEP is the duration of post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES). The mechanisms underlying PGES are unknown. Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in SUDEP pathophysiology. Seizures suppress activity of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). We hypothesized that suppression of DRN 5-HT neuron activity contributes to PGES and increasing 5-HT neurotransmission or stimulating the DRN before a seizure would decrease PGES duration. Adult C57BL/6J and Pet1-Cre mice received EEG/EMG electrodes, a bipolar stimulating/recording electrode in the right basolateral amygdala, and either a microdialysis guide cannula or an injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) allowing expression of channelrhodopsin2 plus an optic fiber into the DRN. Systemic application of the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor citalopram (20 mg/kg) decreased PGES duration from seizures induced during wake (n = 23) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (n = 13) whereas fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) pretreatment decreased PGES duration following seizures induced from wake (n = 11), but not NREM sleep (n = 9). Focal chemical (n = 6) or optogenetic (n = 8) stimulation of the DRN reduced PGES duration following seizures in kindled mice induced during wake. During PGES, animals exhibited immobility and suppression of EEG activity that was reduced by citalopram pretreatment. These results suggest 5-HT and the DRN may regulate PGES.},

We implemented two previously reported classifiers trained on the benchmark dataset whose accuracies were observed to drop sharply when evaluated on a test set. We propose a feature, engineered specifically, for epilepsy diagnosis that attempts to characterize the neuronal synchronization using scalp EEG by extending the concept of the impulse response of linear time-invariant systems to matrices. This feature was tested on the EEG of 50 epileptics and 50 healthy subjects and yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87. It outperforms the existing models implemented by us that gave the AUC of 0.80 when trained and tested on scalp EEG data, thereby, setting the new benchmark for automated epilepsy diagnosis on test set evaluation. The feature has also been shown to have statistical consistency across time and vigilance states with robustness against EEG artifacts.},

Progress on seizure forecasting, however, has been hindered by lack of sufficient data to rigorously evaluate the hypothesis that seizures are preceded by physiological changes, and are not simply random events. We investigated seizure forecasting in three dogs with naturally occurring focal epilepsy implanted with a device recording continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG). The iEEG spectral power in six frequency bands: delta (0.1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), low-gamma (30-70 Hz), and high-gamma (70-180 Hz), were used as features. Logistic regression classifiers were trained to discriminate labeled pre-ictal and inter-ictal data segments using combinations of the band spectral power features. Performance was assessed on separate test data sets via 10-fold cross-validation. A total of 125 spontaneous seizures were detected in continuous iEEG recordings spanning 6.5 to 15 months from 3 dogs. When considering all seizures, the seizure forecasting algorithm performed significantly better than a Poisson-model chance predictor constrained to have the same time in warning for all 3 dogs over a range of total warning times. Seizure clusters were observed in all 3 dogs, and when the effect of seizure clusters was decreased by considering the subset of seizures separated by at least 4 hours, the forecasting performance remained better than chance for a subset of algorithm parameters. These results demonstrate that seizures in canine epilepsy are not randomly occurring events, and highlight the feasibility of long-term seizure forecasting using iEEG monitoring.},

	abstract = {To derive tests for randomness, nonlinear-independence, and stationarity, we combine surrogates with a nonlinear prediction error, a nonlinear interdependence measure, and linear variability measures, respectively. We apply these tests to intracranial electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) from patients suffering from pharmacoresistant focal-onset epilepsy. These recordings had been performed prior to and independent from our study as part of the epilepsy diagnostics. The clinical purpose of these recordings was to delineate the brain areas to be surgically removed in each individual patient in order to achieve seizure control. This allowed us to define two distinct sets of signals: One set of signals recorded from brain areas where the first ictal EEG signal changes were detected as judged by expert visual inspection ("focal signals") and one set of signals recorded from brain areas that were not involved at seizure onset ("nonfocal signals"). We find more rejections for both the randomness and the nonlinear-independence test for focal versus nonfocal signals. In contrast more rejections of the stationarity test are found for nonfocal signals. Furthermore, while for nonfocal signals the rejection of the stationarity test increases the rejection probability of the randomness and nonlinear-independence test substantially, we find a much weaker influence for the focal signals. In consequence, the contrast between the focal and nonfocal signals obtained from the randomness and nonlinear-independence test is further enhanced when we exclude signals for which the stationarity test is rejected. To study the dependence between the randomness and nonlinear-independence test we include only focal signals for which the stationarity test is not rejected. We show that the rejection of these two tests correlates across signals. The rejection of either test is, however, neither necessary nor sufficient for the rejection of the other test. Thus, our results suggest that EEG signals from epileptogenic brain areas are less random, more nonlinear-dependent, and more stationary compared to signals recorded from nonepileptogenic brain areas. We provide the data, source code, and detailed results in the public domain.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system that predisposes individuals to experiencing recurrent seizures. It affects 3 million Americans and 50 million people world-wide. A seizure is a transient aberration in the brain's electrical activity that produces disruptive physical symptoms such as a lapse in attention and memory, a sensory hallucination, or a whole-body convulsion. Approximately 1 out of every 3 individuals with epilepsy continues to experience frequent seizures despite treatment with multiple anti-epileptic drugs. These intractable seizures pose a serious risk of injury, limit the independence and mobility of an individual, and result in both social isolation and economic hardship. This thesis presents novel technology intended to ease the burden of intractable seizures. At its heart is a method for computerized detection of seizure onset. The method uses machine learning to construct patient-specific classifiers that are capable of rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of seizure onset. The algorithm detects the onset of a seizure through analysis of the brain's electrical activity alone or in concert with other physiologic signals. When trained on 2 or more seizures and tested on 844 hours of continuous scalp EEG from 23 pediatric epilepsy patients, our algorithm detected 96\% of 163 test seizures with a median detection delay of 3 seconds and a median false detection rate of 2 false detections per 24 hour period.},

As a preanalysis step an inclusion criterion of weak stationarity was applied. Surface EEG recordings with eyes open were compatible with the surrogates’ null hypothesis of a Gaussian linear stochastic process. Strongest indications of nonlinear deterministic dynamics were found for seizure activity. Results of the other sets were found to be inbetween these two extremes.},

	abstract = {Research in seizure prediction has come a long way since its debut almost 4 decades ago. Early studies suffered methodological caveats leading to overoptimistic results and lack of statistical significance. The publication of guidelines addressing mainly the question of performance evaluation and statistical validation in seizure prediction helped revising the status of the field. While many studies failed to prove that above chance prediction is possible by applying these guidelines, other studies were successful. Methods based on EEG analysis using linear and nonlinear measures were reportedly successful in detecting preictal changes and using them to predict seizures above chance. In this review, we present a selection of studies in seizure prediction published in the last decade. The studies were selected based on the validity of the methods and the statistical significance of performance results. These results varied between studies and many showed acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity that could be appealing for therapeutic devices. The relatively large prediction horizon and early preictal changes reported in most studies suggest that seizure prediction may work better in closed loop seizure control devices rather than as seizure advisory devices. The emergence of a large database of annotated long-term EEG recordings should help prospective assessment of prediction methods. Some questions remain to be addressed before large clinical trials involving seizure prediction can be carried out.},

Intervention before the onset of seizure manifestations could be envisioned with accurate seizure forecasting. Although efforts for better prediction have been made, the translation of current approaches to clinical applications is still not possible. While early findings have been optimistic, the absence of statistical validation and reproducibility has raised doubts about the existence of a preictal state. Analysis and algorithmic studies are providing evidence that transition to the ictal state is not random, with build-up leading to seizures. We have reviewed the general framework of reliable algorithmic seizure prediction studies, discussing each component of the whole block diagram. We have explored steps along the pathway, from signal acquisition to adequate performance evaluation that should be taken into account in the design of an efficient seizure advisory/intervention system. The present review has established that there is potential for improvement and optimization in the seizure prediction framework. New databases, higher sampling frequencies, adequate preprocessing, electrode selection, and machine-learning considerations are all elements of the prediction scheme that should be assessed to achieve more realistic, better-than-chance performances.},

Objective: This paper proposes a patient-specific approach for short-term prediction (i.e., within few minutes) of epileptic seizures. Methods: We use noninvasive EEG data, since the aim is exploring the possibility of developing a noninvasive monitoring/control device for the prediction of seizures. Our approach is based on finding synchronization patterns in the EEG that allow to distinguish in real time preictal from interictal states. In practice, we develop easily computable functions over a graph model to capture the variations in the synchronization, and employ a classifier for identifying the preictal state. Results: We compare two state-of-the-art classification algorithms and a simple and computationally inexpensive threshold-based classifier developed ad hoc. Results on publicly available scalp EEG database and on scalp data of the patients of the Unit of Neurology and Neurophysiology at University of Siena show that this simple and computationally viable processing is able to highlight the changes in synchronization when a seizure is approaching. Conclusion and significance: The proposed approach, characterized by low computational requirements and by the use of noninvasive techniques, is a step toward the development of portable and wearable devices for real-life use.},

	abstract = {Epileptic seizures occur due to brain abnormalities that can indirectly affect patient’s health. It occurs abruptly without any symptoms and thus increases the mortality rate of humans. Almost 1\% of world’s population suffers from epileptic seizures. Prediction of seizures before the beginning of onset is beneficial for preventing seizures by medication. Nowadays, modern computational tools, machine learning, and deep learning methods have been used to predict seizures using EEG. However, EEG signals may get corrupted with background noise, and artifacts such as eye blinks and physical movements of muscles may lead to “pops” in the signal, resulting in electrical interference, which is cumbersome to detect through visual inspection for longer duration recordings. These limitations in automatic detection of interictal spikes and epileptic seizures are preferred, which is an essential tool for examining and scrutinizing the EEG recording more precisely. These restrictions bring our attention to present a review of automated schemes that will help neurologists categorize epileptic and nonepileptic signals. While preparing this review paper, it is observed that feature selection and classification are the main challenges in epilepsy prediction algorithms. This paper presents various techniques depending on various features and classifiers over the last few years. The methods presented will give a detailed understanding and ideas about seizure prediction and future research directions.},

An interictal codebook and preictal codebook, representing the local segments, are constructed by a clustering algorithm. Within a period of EEG signal on all electrodes, local segments are projected onto the learned codebooks. The proposed feature expresses the synchronization pattern of EEG signal with the histogram feature. Moreover, extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to classify the sequence of features. Experiments are performed on the Kaggle seizure prediction challenge dataset and the CHB-MIT dataset. The experiment on the CHB-MIT achieves a sensitivity of 88.24\% and a false prediction rate per hour of 0.25.},

Illustration of the classification is enacted by tables, a glossary of relevant terms, mapping of old to new terms, suggested abbreviations, and examples. Basic and extended versions of the classification are available, depending on the desired degree of detail. Key signs and symptoms of seizures (semiology) are used as a basis for categories of seizures that are focal or generalized from onset or with unknown onset. Any focal seizure can further be optionally characterized by whether awareness is retained or impaired. Impaired awareness during any segment of the seizure renders it a focal impaired awareness seizure. Focal seizures are further optionally characterized by motor onset signs and symptoms: atonic, automatisms, clonic, epileptic spasms, or hyperkinetic, myoclonic, or tonic activity. Nonmotor-onset seizures can manifest as autonomic, behavior arrest, cognitive, emotional, or sensory dysfunction. The earliest prominent manifestation defines the seizure type, which might then progress to other signs and symptoms. Focal seizures can become bilateral tonic–clonic. Generalized seizures engage bilateral networks from onset. Generalized motor seizure characteristics comprise atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, myoclonic, myoclonic–atonic, myoclonic–tonic–clonic, tonic, or tonic–clonic. Nonmotor (absence) seizures are typical or atypical, or seizures that present prominent myoclonic activity or eyelid myoclonia. Seizures of unknown onset may have features that can still be classified as motor, nonmotor, tonic–clonic, epileptic spasms, or behavior arrest. This “users’ manual” for the ILAE 2017 seizure classification will assist the adoption of the new system.},

Because current knowledge is insufficient to form a scientifically based classification, the 2017 Classification is operational (practical) and based on the 1981 Classification, extended in 2010. Changes include the following: (1) “partial” becomes “focal”; (2) awareness is used as a classifier of focal seizures; (3) the terms dyscognitive, simple partial, complex partial, psychic, and secondarily generalized are eliminated; (4) new focal seizure types include automatisms, behavior arrest, hyperkinetic, autonomic, cognitive, and emotional; (5) atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, myoclonic, and tonic seizures can be of either focal or generalized onset; (6) focal to bilateral tonic–clonic seizure replaces secondarily generalized seizure; (7) new generalized seizure types are absence with eyelid myoclonia, myoclonic absence, myoclonic–atonic, myoclonic–tonic–clonic; and (8) seizures of unknown onset may have features that can still be classified.

	abstract = {Neuromarketing is the application of neuroscience to the understanding of consumer preferences toward products and services. As such, it studies the neural activity associated with preference and purchase intent. Neuromarketing is considered an emerging area of research, driven in part by the approximately 400 billion dollars spent annually on advertisement and promotion. Given the size of this market, even a slight improvement in performance can have an immense impact. Traditional approaches to marketing consider a posteriori user feedback in the form of questionnaires, product ratings, or review comments, but these approaches do not fully capture or explain the real-time decision-making process of consumers. Various physiological measurement techniques have been proposed to facilitate the recording of this crucial aspect of the decision-making process, including brain imaging techniques [functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), steady state topography (SST)], and various biometric sensors. The use of EEG in neuromarketing is especially promising. EEG detects the sequential changes of brain activity, without appreciable time delay, needed to assess both the unconscious reaction and sensory reaction of the customer. Several types of EEG devices are now available in the market, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Researchers have conducted experiments using many of these devices, across different age groups and different categories of products. Because of the deep insights that can be gained, the field of neuromarketing research is carefully monitored by consumer and research protection groups to ensure that subjects are properly protected. This article surveys a range of considerations for EEG-based neuromarketing strategies, including the types of information that can be gathered, how marketing stimuli are presented to consumers, how such strategies may affect the consumer in terms of appeal and memory, machine learning techniques applied in the field, and the variety of challenges faced, including ethics, in this emerging field.},

	abstract = {Objective. The various parameters that define a hand movement such as its trajectory, speed, etc, are encoded in distinct brain activities. Decoding this information from neurophysiological recordings is a less explored area of brain–computer interface (BCI) research. Applying non-invasive recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) for decoding makes the problem more challenging, as the encoding is assumed to be deep within the brain and not easily accessible by scalp recordings. Approach. EEG based BCI systems can be developed to identify the neural features underlying movement parameters that can be further utilized to provide a detailed and well defined control command set to a BCI output device. A real-time continuous control is better suited for practical BCI systems, and can be achieved by continuous adaptive reconstruction of movement trajectory than discrete brain activity classifications. In this work, we adaptively reconstruct/estimate the parameters of two-dimensional hand movement trajectory, namely movement speed and position, from multi-channel EEG recordings. The data for analysis is collected by performing an experiment that involved center-out right-hand movement tasks in four different directions at two different speeds in random order. We estimate movement trajectory using a Kalman filter that models the relation between brain activity and recorded parameters based on a set of defined predictors. We propose a method to define these predictor variables that includes spatial, spectral and temporally localized neural information and to select optimally informative variables. Main results. The proposed method yielded correlation of (0.60 ± 0.07) between recorded and estimated data. Further, incorporating the proposed predictor subset selection, the correlation achieved is (0.57 ± 0.07, p with significant gain in stability of the system, as well as dramatic reduction in number of predictors (76\%) for the savings of computational time. Significance. The proposed system provides a real time movement control system using EEG-BCI with control over movement speed and position. These results are higher and statistically significant compared to existing techniques in EEG based systems and thus promise the applicability of the proposed method for efficient estimation of movement parameters and for continuous motor control.},

We investigate if it is possible to capture useful EEG signals to detect if relevant objects are present in a dataset of realistic and complex images. We perform several experiments using a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of images at different rates (5Hz and 10Hz) on 8 users with different degrees of familiarization with BCI and the dataset. We then use the feedback from the BCI and mouse-based interfaces to retrieve localized objects in a subset of TRECVid images. We show that it is indeed possible to detect such objects in complex images and, also, that users with previous knowledge on the dataset or experience with the RSVP outperform others. When the users have limited time to annotate the images (100 seconds in our experiments) both interfaces are comparable in performance. Comparing our best users in a retrieval task, we found that EEG-based relevance feedback outperforms mouse-based feedback. The realistic and complex image dataset differentiates our work from previous studies on EEG for image retrieval.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.06.012},
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Intelligent wheelchair technology has recently been utilised to address several mobility problems. Techniques based on brain-computer interface (BCI) are currently used to develop electric wheelchairs. Using human brain control in wheelchairs for people with disability has elicited widespread attention due to its flexibility.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the background of recent studies on wheelchair control based on BCI for disability and map the literature survey into a coherent taxonomy. The study intends to identify the most important aspects in this emerging field as an impetus for using BCI for disability in electric-powered wheelchair (EPW) control, which remains a challenge. The study also attempts to provide recommendations for solving other existing limitations and challenges.
METHODS: We systematically searched all articles about EPW control based on BCI for disability in three popular databases: ScienceDirect, IEEE and Web of Science. These databases contain numerous articles that considerably influenced this field and cover most of the relevant theoretical and technical issues.
RESULTS: We selected 100 articles on the basis of our inclusion and exclusion criteria. A large set of articles (55) discussed on developing real-time wheelchair control systems based on BCI for disability signals. Another set of articles (25) focused on analysing BCI for disability signals for wheelchair control. The third set of articles (14) considered the simulation of wheelchair control based on BCI for disability signals. Four articles designed a framework for wheelchair control based on BCI for disability signals. Finally, one article reviewed concerns regarding wheelchair control based on BCI for disability signals.
DISCUSSION: Since 2007, researchers have pursued the possibility of using BCI for disability in EPW control through different approaches. Regardless of type, articles have focused on addressing limitations that impede the full efficiency of BCI for disability and recommended solutions for these limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies on wheelchair control based on BCI for disability considerably influence society due to the large number of people with disability. Therefore, we aim to provide researchers and developers with a clear understanding of this platform and highlight the challenges and gaps in the current and future studies.},

The use of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals has become the most common approach for a BCI because of their usability and strong reliability. Many EEG-based BCI devices have been developed with traditional wet- or micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS)-type EEG sensors. However, those traditional sensors have uncomfortable disadvantage and require conductive gel and skin preparation on the part of the user. Therefore, acquiring the EEG signals in a comfortable and convenient manner is an important factor that should be incorporated into a novel BCI device. In the present study, a wearable, wireless and portable EEG-based BCI device with dry foam-based EEG sensors was developed and was demonstrated using a gaming control application. The dry EEG sensors operated without conductive gel; however, they were able to provide good conductivity and were able to acquire EEG signals effectively by adapting to irregular skin surfaces and by maintaining proper skin-sensor impedance on the forehead site. We have also demonstrated a real-time cognitive stage detection application of gaming control using the proposed portable device. The results of the present study indicate that using this portable EEG-based BCI device to conveniently and effectively control the outside world provides an approach for researching rehabilitation engineering.},

This technology allows the human brain to control a robot to perform a series of actions. The processing of EEG signals plays a vital role in the technology of brain-controlled robots. In this paper, the methods of EEG signal processing in recent years are summarized. In order to better develop the EEG signal processing methods in brain-controlled robots, this paper elaborate on three parts: EEG signal pre-processing, feature extraction and feature classification. At the same time, the correlation analysis methods and research contents are introduced. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are analyzed and compared in this paper.

	abstract = {Some patients are no longer able to communicate effectively or even interact with the outside world in ways that most of us take for granted. In the most severe cases, tetraplegic or post-stroke patients are literally 'locked in' their bodies, unable to exert any motor control after, for example, a spinal cord injury or a brainstem stroke, requiring alternative methods of communication and control. But we suggest that, in the near future, their brains may offer them a way out. Non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) can be characterized by the technique used to measure brain activity and by the way that different brain signals are translated into commands that control an effector (e.g., controlling a computer cursor for word processing and accessing the internet). This review focuses on the basic concepts of EEG-based BCI, the main advances in communication, motor control restoration and the downregulation of cortical activity, and the mirror neuron system (MNS) in the context of BCI. The latter appears to be relevant for clinical applications in the coming years, particularly for severely limited patients. Hypothetically, MNS could provide a robust way to map neural activity to behavior, representing the high-level information about goals and intentions of these patients. Non-invasive EEG-based BCIs allow brain-derived communication in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and motor control restoration in patients after spinal cord injury and stroke. Epilepsy and attention deficit and hyperactive disorder patients were able to downregulate their cortical activity. Given the rapid progression of EEG-based BCI research over the last few years and the swift ascent of computer processing speeds and signal analysis techniques, we suggest that emerging ideas (e.g., MNS in the context of BCI) related to clinical neurorehabilitation of severely limited patients will generate viable clinical applications in the near future.},

	abstract = {Measuring neuronal activity with electrophysiological methods may be useful in detecting neurological dysfunctions, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This approach may be particularly valuable for rapid detection in at-risk populations including military service members and athletes. Electrophysiological methods, such as quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and recording event-related potentials (ERPs) may be promising; however, the field is nascent and significant controversy exists on the efficacy and accuracy of the approaches as diagnostic tools. For example, the specific measures derived from an electroencephalogram (EEG) that are most suitable as markers of dysfunction have not been clearly established. A study was conducted to summarize and evaluate the statistical rigor of evidence on the overall utility of qEEG as an mTBI detection tool. The analysis evaluated qEEG measures/parameters that may be most suitable as fieldable diagnostic tools, identified other types of EEG measures and analysis methods of promise, recommended specific measures and analysis methods for further development as mTBI detection tools, identified research gaps in the field, and recommended future research and development thrust areas. The qEEG study group formed the following conclusions: (1) Individual qEEG measures provide limited diagnostic utility for mTBI. However, many measures can be important features of qEEG discriminant functions, which do show significant promise as mTBI detection tools. (2) ERPs offer utility in mTBI detection. In fact, evidence indicates that ERPs can identify abnormalities in cases where EEGs alone are non-disclosing. (3) The standard mathematical procedures used in the characterization of mTBI EEGs should be expanded to incorporate newer methods of analysis including non-linear dynamical analysis, complexity measures, analysis of causal interactions, graph theory, and information dynamics. (4) Reports of high specificity in qEEG evaluations of TBI must be interpreted with care. High specificities have been reported in carefully constructed clinical studies in which healthy controls were compared against a carefully selected TBI population. The published literature indicates, however, that similar abnormalities in qEEG measures are observed in other neuropsychiatric disorders. While it may be possible to distinguish a clinical patient from a healthy control participant with this technology, these measures are unlikely to discriminate between, for example, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or TBI. The specificities observed in these clinical studies may well be lost in real world clinical practice. (5) The absence of specificity does not preclude clinical utility. The possibility of use as a longitudinal measure of treatment response remains. However, efficacy as a longitudinal clinical measure does require acceptable test–retest reliability. To date, very few test–retest reliability studies have been published with qEEG data obtained from TBI patients or from healthy controls. This is a particular concern because high variability is a known characteristic of the injured central nervous system.},

This, in turn, places an ever-increasing burden on healthcare due to the increasing prevalence of patients with chronic illnesses and the reducing income-generating population base needed to sustain them. The need to urgently address this healthcare "time bomb" has accelerated the growth in ubiquitous, pervasive, distributed healthcare technologies. The current move from hospital-centric healthcare toward in-home health assessment is aimed at alleviating the burden on healthcare professionals, the health care system and caregivers. This shift will also further increase the comfort for the patient. Advances in signal acquisition, data storage and communication provide for the collection of reliable and useful in-home physiological data. Artifacts, arising from environmental, experimental and physiological factors, degrade signal quality and render the affected part of the signal useless. The magnitude and frequency of these artifacts significantly increases when data collection is moved from the clinic into the home. Signal processing advances have brought about significant improvement in artifact removal over the past few years. This paper reviews the physiological signals most likely to be recorded in the home, documenting the artifacts which occur most frequently and which have the largest degrading effect. A detailed analysis of current artifact removal techniques will then be presented. An evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the proposed artifact detection and removal techniques, with particular application to the personal healthcare domain, is provided.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Electromyogram (EMG) contamination is often a problem in electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, particularly, for those applications such as EEG-based brain-computer interfaces that rely on automated measurements of EEG features. As an essential prelude to developing methods for recognizing and eliminating EMG contamination of EEG, this study defines the spectral and topographical characteristics of frontalis and temporalis muscle EMG over the entire scalp. It describes both average data and the range of individual differences.
METHODS: In 25 healthy adults, signals from 64 scalp and 4 facial locations were recorded during relaxation and during defined (15, 30, or 70\% of maximum) contractions of frontalis or temporalis muscles.
RESULTS: In the average data, EMG had a broad frequency distribution from 0 to {\textgreater}200 Hz. Amplitude was greatest at 20-30 Hz frontally and 40-80 Hz temporally. Temporalis spectra also showed a smaller peak around 20 Hz. These spectral components attenuated and broadened centrally. Even with weak (15\%) contraction, EMG was detectable (P{\textless}0.001) near the vertex at frequencies {\textgreater}12 Hz in the average data and {\textgreater}8 Hz in some individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Frontalis or temporalis muscle EMG recorded from the scalp has spectral and topographical features that vary substantially across individuals. EMG spectra often have peaks in the beta frequency range that resemble EEG beta peaks.
SIGNIFICANCE: While EMG contamination is greatest at the periphery of the scalp near the active muscles, even weak contractions can produce EMG that obscures or mimics EEG alpha, mu, or beta rhythms over the entire scalp. Recognition and elimination of this contamination is likely to require recording from an appropriate set of peripheral scalp locations.},

	abstract = {A variety of procedures have been proposed to correct ocular artifacts in the electroencephalogram (EEG), including methods based on regression, principal components analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA). The current study compared these three methods, and it evaluated a modified regression approach using Bayesian adaptive regression splines to filter the electrooculogram (EOG) before computing correction factors. We applied each artifact correction procedure to real and simulated EEG data of varying epoch lengths and then quantified the impact of correction on spectral parameters of the EEG. We found that the adaptive filter improved regression-based artifact correction. An automated PCA method effectively reduced ocular artifacts and resulted in minimal spectral distortion, whereas ICA correction appeared to distort power between 5 and 20 Hz. In general, reducing the epoch length improved the accuracy of estimating spectral power in the alpha (7.5-12.5 Hz) and beta (12.5-19.5 Hz) bands, but it worsened the accuracy for power in the theta (3.5-7.5 Hz) band and distorted time domain features. Results supported the use of regression-based and PCA-based ocular artifact correction and suggested a need for further studies examining possible spectral distortion from ICA-based correction procedures.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Biological and non-biological artifacts cause severe problems when dealing with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used method for eliminating various artifacts from recordings. However, evaluating and classifying the calculated independent components (IC) as artifact or EEG is not fully automated at present.
APPROACH: In this study, we propose a new approach for automated artifact elimination, which applies machine learning algorithms to ICA-based features.
MAIN RESULTS: We compared the performance of our classifiers with the visual classification results given by experts. The best result with an accuracy rate of 95\% was achieved using features obtained by range filtering of the topoplots and IC power spectra combined with an artificial neural network.
SIGNIFICANCE: Compared with the existing automated solutions, our proposed method is not limited to specific types of artifacts, electrode configurations, or number of EEG channels. The main advantages of the proposed method is that it provides an automatic, reliable, real-time capable, and practical tool, which avoids the need for the time-consuming manual selection of ICs during artifact removal.},

When compared to EDF, EDF+ can not only store annotations but also electromyography, evoked potentials, electroneurography, electrocardiography and many more types of investigations. Further improvements over EDF include the use of standard electrode names. EDF+ is so much like EDF that existing EDF viewers still display the signals in EDF+ files.

	abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is the standard diagnosis method for a wide variety of diseases such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, encephalopathies, and coma, among others. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI) is currently a technique used in research in both healthy individuals as well as patients. EEG and fMRI are procedures used to obtain direct and indirect measurements of brain neural activity: EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp, and fMRI detects the changes in blood oxygenation that occur in response to neural activity. EEG has a high temporal resolution and low spatial resolution, while fMRI has high spatial resolution and low temporal resolution. Thus, the combination of EEG with rs-fMRI using different methods could be very useful for research and clinical applications. In this article, we describe and show the results of a new methodology for processing rs-fMRI using seeds positioned according to the 10-10 EEG standard. We analyze the functional connectivity and adjacency matrices obtained using 65 seeds based on 10-10 EEG scheme and 21 seeds based on 10-20 EEG. Connectivity networks are created using each 10-20 EEG seeds and are analyzed by comparisons to the seven networks that have been found in recent studies. The proposed method captures high correlation between contralateral seeds, ipsilateral and contralateral occipital seeds, and some in the frontal lobe.},

	abstract = {Purpose: We present two methods of implantation for the investigation of suspected insular and perisylvian epilepsy that combine depth and subdural electrodes to capitalize on the advantages of each technique. Methods: Retrospective study of all intracranial EEG studies that included insular electrodes from 2004–2010. Patients were divided according to the implantation scheme. The first method (type 1) consisted of a craniotomy, insertion of insular electrodes after microdissection of the sylvian fissure, orthogonal implantation of mesiotemporal structures with neuronavigation, and coverage of the adjacent lobes with subdural electrodes. The second method (type 2) consisted of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–stereotactic frame-guided depth electrode implantation into insula and hippocampus using sagittal axes, and insertion of subdural electrodes through burr holes to cover the adjacent lobes. The combined implantations were developed and performed by one neurosurgeon (AB). Key Findings: Nineteen patients had an intracranial study that sampled the insula, among other regions. Sixteen patients were implanted using the first method, which allowed a mean of 4, 5, 20, 15, and 42 contacts per patient to be positioned into/over the insular, mesial temporal, neocortical temporal, parietal, and frontal areas, respectively. The second method (three patients) allowed a mean of 8, 7, 16, 6, and 9 contacts per patient to sample the same areas, respectively. The four patients in whom transient neurologic deficits occurred were investigated with use of type 1 implantation. Significance: Combined depth and subdural electrodes can be used safely to investigate complex insular/perisylvian refractory epilepsy. Choice of implantation scheme should be individualized according to presurgical data and the need for functional localization.},

	abstract = {Since the second half of the twentieth century, intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), including both electrocorticography (ECoG) and stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG), has provided an intimate view into the human brain. At the interface between fundamental research and the clinic, iEEG provides both high temporal resolution and high spatial specificity but comes with constraints, such as the individual's tailored sparsity of electrode sampling. Over the years, researchers in neuroscience developed their practices to make the most of the iEEG approach. Here we offer a critical review of iEEG research practices in a didactic framework for newcomers, as well addressing issues encountered by proficient researchers. The scope is threefold: (i) review common practices in iEEG research, (ii) suggest potential guidelines for working with iEEG data and answer frequently asked questions based on the most widespread practices, and (iii) based on current neurophysiological knowledge and methodologies, pave the way to good practice standards in iEEG research. The organization of this paper follows the steps of iEEG data processing. The first section contextualizes iEEG data collection. The second section focuses on localization of intracranial electrodes. The third section highlights the main pre-processing steps. The fourth section presents iEEG signal analysis methods. The fifth section discusses statistical approaches. The sixth section draws some unique perspectives on iEEG research. Finally, to ensure a consistent nomenclature throughout the manuscript and to align with other guidelines, e.g., Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) and the OHBM Committee on Best Practices in Data Analysis and Sharing (COBIDAS), we provide a glossary to disambiguate terms related to iEEG research.},

	abstract = {The human brain achieves visual object recognition through multiple stages of linear and nonlinear transformations operating at a millisecond scale. To predict and explain these rapid transformations, computational neuroscientists employ machine learning modeling techniques. However, state-of-the-art models require massive amounts of data to properly train, and to the present day there is a lack of vast brain datasets which extensively sample the temporal dynamics of visual object recognition. Here we collected a large and rich dataset of high temporal resolution EEG responses to images of objects on a natural background. This dataset includes 10 participants, each with 82,160 trials spanning 16,740 image conditions. Through computational modeling we established the quality of this dataset in five ways. First, we trained linearizing encoding models that successfully synthesized the EEG responses to arbitrary images. Second, we correctly identified the recorded EEG data image conditions in a zero-shot fashion, using EEG synthesized responses to hundreds of thousands of candidate image conditions. Third, we show that both the high number of conditions as well as the trial repetitions of the EEG dataset contribute to the trained models’ prediction accuracy. Fourth, we built encoding models whose predictions well generalize to novel participants. Fifth, we demonstrate full end-to-end training of randomly initialized DNNs that output EEG responses for arbitrary input images. We release this dataset as a tool to foster research in visual neuroscience and computer vision.
Event-related potential (ERP) studies investigating the processing of self-induced stimuli often rely on the assumption that ballistic actions and motor ERPs are constant across different sets of action effects. Since recent studies challenge this motor equivalence assumption, we examined whether neglecting effect-related motor differences can bias the estimation of auditory ERPs in a typical action-related ERP attenuation paradigm. We increased action variability with a force production task and selected an event subset in which the motor equivalence assumption was true. ERP attenuation estimated in this subset was compared with attenuation obtained in the standard task, where motor differences were not controlled. Violation of the motor equivalence assumption resulted in a positive deflection overlapping auditory ERPs elicited by self-induced sounds, leading to the overestimation of N1- and underestimation of P2-attenuation. This demonstrates that sensory-effect-related motor differences should be considered when separating sensory and motor components in ERPs elicited by self-induced stimuli.
Successful memory performance depends on overlap between neural representations at encoding and retrieval. With older age, neural similarity, memory performance, and sleep quality decline. Regardless of age, racial/ethnic minorities tend to experience poor sleep, which may contribute to poor memory. Previous studies have not investigated memory performance, neural similarity, sleep quality, and age in diverse participants. Here, we recruited racially/ethnically diverse adults across the lifespan and examined night-to-night sleep quality in relation to memory performance and encoding-retrieval similarity. We employed item-specific, representational similarity analysis (not confounded by effort, word perception, or differences in electroencephalography signal amplitude) to assess neural similarity for intact and recombined paired associates. Greater sleep variance and poorer memory performance were more strongly associated with older age. Interestingly, sleep variance was positively associated with neural similarity for intact pairs. This relationship was stronger with younger age and for racial/ethnic minorities. For recombined pairs, greater sleep variance was associated with reduced neural similarity. Thus, varied sleep may induce greater reliance on familiarity, while consistent sleep may support recollection.
According to current research, the electrophysiological responses to self evaluation are influenced by social comparison. Using the event-related potential (ERP), we explored the neural mechanisms of the self evaluation of a depression tendency using a social comparison (stranger-result). The subjects engaged in a two-person, money game task with a stranger. The behavioral results showed that the subjects were more satisfied with self-win than with self-loss, and the self-result regarding satisfaction was unaffected by a depression tendency or a stranger-result. The electroencephalogram (EEG) results showed that as self-result, self-win induced a larger P2, a smaller feedback-related negativity (FRN), and a larger P3 than self-loss; the self-result effect was influenced by a depression tendency and a stranger-result in the early and middle latency windows, respectively, and affected by a stranger-result in the later latency window; the non-depression tendency (NDT) group induced a larger P2 than the depression tendency (DT) group; a stranger-loss induced a larger P2 and P3 than a stranger-win in self-loss; a stranger-win induced a larger P2 and P3 than a stranger-loss in self-win; the DT group was the same as the NDT group in self-loss; the DT group induced a larger FRN than the NDT group in self-win. Our research indicates that the self evaluation is affected by a depression tendency and stranger-result respectively, and in the two-person game, the subjective report of the subjects contains a certain degree of concealment.
Identifying epilepsy in local indigenous populations and describing its epidemiological, etiological, electroencephalographic, and therapeutic aspects can assist public health policies planning toward epilepsy in indigenous communities.
This descriptive, cross-sectional study investigated epilepsy among indigenous people residing in Jaguapirú Village, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Participants had their clinical histories reviewed and physical examination performed, as well as one or more electroencephalograms (EEG) registered. Other laboratory tests and neuroimaging data available were analyzed and patients with nonepileptic paroxysmal events were additionally identified.
Out of 2,994 respondents, 49 had a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy (2.37\%) and 22 had self-limited epileptic syndromes, a rate that exceeds the global prevalence but is close to other data reported in the Brazilian population. Focal epilepsy, predominantly from temporal lobe origin, was the most prevalent epileptic syndrome (71.4\%). Febrile seizures occurred in only 0.4\% of respondents, much lower rate than reported in the general population, which can be attributed to the cross-sectional study design. The etiology of epilepsy was undetermined in 82.6\% of cases, with the remaining cases attributed to head trauma, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and brain malformations. A history of delayed neuropsychomotor development was significantly associated with epilepsy. Monotherapy with first-generation antiseizure medications was greatly effective in most epilepsy cases (87.7\%). Electroencephalogram helped to define focal epilepsies and diagnose seizures of nonepileptic origin; the latter mostly included cases of psychogenic seizures and, less frequently, syncope.
Diagnosing epilepsy, its clinical presentation, and therapeutical response profile in traditional communities is essential for the establishment of public health policies in developing countries and may help community involvement for successful treatment.
Despite the introduction of several adjuncts to improve spinal perfusion, spinal cord ischemia (SCI) remains a devastating complication of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. Our aim was to assess the effects on clinical outcome of interventions triggered by motor evoked potentials (MEP) alerts. Furthermore, we want to assess whether a multimodal intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IONM) protocol is helpful for stratifying patients according to the risk of SCI at the end of the vascular phase of surgery.
We prospectively studied one-hundred consecutive patients who underwent TAAA repair. We applied a multimodal IONM including MEP, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and peripheral nerve monitoring techniques. Signal deteriorations were classified as reversible/irreversible according to whether they recovered or not at the end of monitoring (EOM), set at the end of the vascular phase of surgery. Significant MEP changes drove a series of corrective measures aimed to improve spinal perfusion.
The rate of immediate postoperative motor deficits consistent with SCI was significantly higher with irreversible MEP deteriorations compared to reversible ones. The interpretation of MEP findings at the EOM led to the development of risk categories for SCI, based on the association between MEP results and motor outcome.
Our data seem to justify interventions made to reverse MEP deterioration in order to improve the clinical outcome. A multimodal IONM protocol could improve MEP interpretation at the end of the vascular phase of surgery, supporting the surgeon in their decision-making, before concluding vascular maneuvers.},

	abstract = {EEG records the brain's electrical function. It displays the difference in voltages from distinct sites of the brain over a period of time. It plays a major role in understanding the brain. It also helps to diagnose disorders related to sleep, and find the epileptogenic foci in the brain. Recording accurate EEG signals, however, comes with its own limitations. Gels applied to the scalp are abrasive in nature. Gels dry up over time, and also irritate the skin. There are different kinds of electrodes that record EEG signals with appreciable accuracy, keeping comfort and practicality in mind. Some of them are: dry electrodes, capacitive electrodes, electrodes with nanomaterials. The electrodes mentioned above are discussed in this paper. It discusses the advancement in the field of EEG. This paper shows the ease at which signals can be captured, using the aforementioned electrodes. Cheaper, more accessible EEG electrodes are making it possible to bring affordable healthcare outside the confines of the hospitals and clinics.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is an electrophysiological disorder of the brain, characterized by recurrent seizures. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures and records the electrical activity of the brain, and is widely used in the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures. However, it is often difficult to identify subtle but critical changes in the EEG waveform by visual inspection, thus opening up a vast research area for biomedical engineers to develop and implement several intelligent algorithms for the identification of such subtle changes. Moreover, the EEG signals are nonlinear and non-stationary in nature, which contribute to further complexities related to their manual interpretation and detection of normal and abnormal (interictal and ictal) activities. Hence, it is necessary to develop a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system to automatically identify the normal and abnormal activities using minimum number of highly discriminating features in classifiers. It has been found that nonlinear features are able to capture the complex physiological phenomena such as abrupt transitions and chaotic behavior in the EEG signals. In this review, we discuss various feature extraction methods and the results of different automated epilepsy stage detection techniques in detail. We also briefly present the various open ended challenges that need to be addressed before a CAD based epilepsy detection system can be set-up in a clinical setting.},

	abstract = {Introduction: 
An increased prevalence of pathological electroencephalography (EEG) signals has been reported in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). In an elaborative case description of such a patient with intermittent rhythmic delta and theta activity (IRDA/IRTA), the BPD symptoms where linked to the frequency of the IRDAs/IRTAs and vanished with the IRDAs/IRTAs following anticonvulsive therapy. This observation raised a question regarding the prevalence of such EEG abnormalities in BPD patients. The aim of this retrospective study was to identify the frequency of EEG abnormalities in a carefully analyzed psychiatric collective. Following earlier reports, we hypothesized an increased prevalence of EEG abnormalities in BPD patients.

Participants and methods:
We recruited 96 consecutive patients with BPD from the archive of a university clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy, and compared the prevalence of EEG abnormalities to those of 76 healthy controls subjects. The EEGs were rated by three different blinded clinicians, including a consultant specializing in epilepsy from the local epilepsy center.

Results:
We found a significant increase in the prevalence of IRDAs and IRTAs in BPD patients (14.6\%) compared to the control subjects (3.9\%; p = 0.020).

Discussion:
In this blinded retrospective case-control study, we were able to confirm an increased prevalence of pathological EEG findings (IRDAs/IRTAs only) in BPD patients. The major limitation of this study is that the control group was not matched on age and gender. Therefore, the results should be regarded as preliminary findings of an open uncontrolled, retrospective study. Future research performing prospective, controlled studies is needed to verify our findings and answer the question of whether such EEG findings might predict a positive response to anticonvulsive pharmacological treatment.},

	abstract = {Human brain consists of millions of neurons which are playing an important role for controlling behavior of human body with respect to internal/external motor/sensory stimuli. These neurons will act as information carriers between human body and brain. Understanding cognitive behaviour of brain can be done by analyzing either signals or images from the brain. Human behaviour can be visualized in terms of motor and sensory states such as, eye movement, lip movement, remembrance, attention, hand clenching etc. These states are related with specific signal frequency which helps to understand functional behavior of complex brain structure. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an efficient modality which helps to acquire brain signals corresponds to various states from the scalp surface area. These signals are generally categorized as delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma based on signal frequencies ranges from 0.1Hz to more than 100Hz. This paper primarily focuses on EEG signals and its characterization with respect to various states of human body. It also deals with experimental setup used in EEG analysis.},

	abstract = {Objective: To estimate the prevalence of depression in persons with epilepsy (PWE) and the strength of association between these 2 conditions.
Methods: The MEDLINE (1948–2012), EMBASE (1980–2012), and PsycINFO (1806–2012) databases, reference lists of retrieved articles, and conference abstracts were searched. Content experts were also consulted. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and extracted data. For inclusion, studies were population-based, original research, and reported on epilepsy and depression. Estimates of depression prevalence among PWE and of the association between epilepsy and depression (estimated with reported odds ratios [ORs]) are provided.
Results: Of 7,106 abstracts screened, 23 articles reported on 14 unique data sources. Nine studies reported on 29,891 PWE who had an overall prevalence of active (current or past-year) depression of 23.1\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 20.6\%–28.31\%). Five of the 14 studies reported on 1,217,024 participants with an overall OR of active depression of 2.77 (95\% CI 2.09–3.67) in PWE. For lifetime depression, 4 studies reported on 5,454 PWE, with an overall prevalence of 13.0\% (95\% CI 5.1–33.1), and 3 studies reported on 4,195 participants with an overall OR of 2.20 (95\% CI 1.07–4.51) for PWE.
Conclusions: Epilepsy was significantly associated with depression and depression was observed to be highly prevalent in PWE. These findings highlight the importance of proper identification and management of depression in PWE.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy was defined conceptually in 2005 as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures. This definition is usually practically applied as having two unprovoked seizures {\textgreater}24 h apart. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) accepted recommendations of a task force altering the practical definition for special circumstances that do not meet the two unprovoked seizures criteria. The task force proposed that epilepsy be considered to be a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions: (1) At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring {\textgreater}24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60\%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who either had an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past the applicable age or who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years and off antiseizure medicines for at least the last 5 years. “Resolved” is not necessarily identical to the conventional view of “remission or “cure.” Different practical definitions may be formed and used for various specific purposes. This revised definition of epilepsy brings the term in concordance with common use. A PowerPoint slide summarizing this article is available for download in the Supporting Information section here.},
