\section{Problem definition}
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, which are brief episodes of abnormal brain activity that can cause a range of symptoms including convulsions, changes in behavior, and loss of consciousness. Seizures can have a significant impact on the quality of life of individuals with epilepsy, and they can also have serious health consequences if not properly managed \cite{fisher_ilae_2014} \cite{stafstrom_seizures_2015}. 

Current treatments for epilepsy include medications, surgery, and other therapeutic interventions, but these approaches are not always effective in controlling seizures. Predicting seizures in advance could potentially allow individuals with epilepsy to take preventative measures and avoid situations that may trigger a seizure. It could also enable medical professionals to intervene more quickly and effectively in the event of a seizure.

In this thesis, we describe the development and evaluation of a system for predicting epileptic seizures. We aim to answer the following research question: Can our seizure prediction system provide accurate and timely warning of impending seizures, and can it be used to improve seizure management and the quality of life for individuals with epilepsy?

The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows: In Chapter 2, we review the state of the art in epilepsy prediction. In Chapter 3, we describe the design and implementation of our seizure prediction system. In Chapter 4, we present the results of our evaluation of the system. Finally, in Chapter 5, we discuss the implications of our work and suggest directions for future research.
